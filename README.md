# firstGiphyAPI
First ApI using Giphy

In this API I connected with Giphy to use their information to make my own page about superheroes. 
I started with building my html page with bootstrap components to get the basic styling with the buttons and setup of my well and submit button.

I then reference an external javascript page to get the logic portion of the page to work. I also referenced Jquery so I can use their library as well. 

In my javascript page I have my giphy website along with my key so that I can use ajax to query what I want from the giphy API.

I have listed variables so they will do specific actions like make my giphy images pause, have a rating associated with them , or animate.

I then used Jquery to listen for when someone has input a hero into the submit well and hits the submit button to create a new button for that hero.

Then once that button has been created, the user can click on that button and images will come up of that hero and they can click on them to animate or make them still.

I also have an external styling page to help add some more detailed styling aspects to the page.
